## *At a Glance*

Broadly, I'm an interdisciplinary data scientist with special interests in psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, statistics, and Japanese. More specifically, I apply statistical and natural language processing techniques to solve problems and enrich my and my team's understanding of whatever data is at hand. I bring a strong statistical background to my work, whether in the form of data handling, ad-hoc statistical analyses, or machine learning applications.

## *Skills*

- Programming (*R, Python, SQL, Ruby, Julia, Go*)

- Data analysis (*MiniTab, SPSS, Tableau, KNIME, Google Data Studio, Qualtrics, Excel, Access, Power BI*)

- Research (*Research design, data visualization, scientific writing*)

- Statistics (*Bayesian & frequentist approaches, multiple regression, ANOVA, SEM/MLM*)

- Language (*Advanced Japanese, language instruction, natural language processing*)

## *Projects*
### My larger projects, more immediately relevant to my research interests and past academic work:

- [particles](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/particles), contextual particle frequency in written Japanese, taking a swing at the age old question of は vs が
- [thesis](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/thesis), the scripts and analyses from my graduate thesis work, ["Investigating Emotion-label and Emotion-laden Words in a Semantic Satiation Paradigm"](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/10346/)
- [aozora_corpus](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/aozora_corpus), a compilation of Japanese texts pulled from 青空文庫, also available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryancahildebrandt/azbcorpus)
- [embs](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/embs), a project to provide tools streamlining sentence embedding or clustering techniques 
- [siftr](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/siftr), a Shiny app using SIF sentence embeddings to separate out unwanted text data
- [priors](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/priors), an experiment combining pretrained and bag of words embeddings to incorporate prior semantic knowledge
- [bowts](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/bowts), an experiment combining pretrained and bag of words embedding approaches for embedding vector space manipulation
- [iterate](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/iterate), iterative clustering for sklearn clusterers
- [topics](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/topics), experiments and utilities for text topic extraction using decision trees 
- [simsort](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/simsort), sorting texts by semantic similarity
- [nlt](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/nlt), representing tabular data in natural language
- [gsgf](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/gsgf), generate natural language expressions from JSGF

#### Some stats/NLP/dataviz side work I've done, partially of personal interest, partially to learn different data techniques, and partially to serve as a quick reference in my day to day work:

- [dists](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/dists), simple reference and tools for working with probability distributions
- [trendsim](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/trendsim), simulating social media traffic for Japanese authors using Markov Chains, MongoDB, and Kafka
- [genji](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/genji), character networks in The Tale of Genji
- [shrimp](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/shrimp), a bayesian time series analysis of some very specific tweets
- [radicals](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/radicals), some experiments with embedding kanji in vector spaces based on radical composition, readings, and meanings
- [hanakotoba](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/hanakotoba), a project looking at the use of 花言葉 in literature 
- [yoji](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/yoji), applying neural networks to generate novel 四字熟語 idioms

- [kyoto](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/kyoto), an exploration of restaurants around train/subway stations in Kyoto
- [manyogana](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/manyogana), an application to translate Japanese text to a modern implementation of manyogana, as well as converting arabic numerals to kansuuji
- [movies](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/movies), a dataviz/exploration dashboard for the 10,000 movies dataset
- [michelin](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/michelin), exploration of Michelin star restaurants
- [tea_temps](https://github.com/ryancahildebrandt/tea_temps), a quick dataviz and reference for getting a good cup of tea
